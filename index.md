# Landing Page

I am managing the notes here via

- [mkdnflow][mkdnflow] in [neovim][neovim]
  and

- [GitJournal][GitJournal] on my iPhone.

[mkdnflow][mkdnflow]'s author
[recommends][start] using `index.md` as the
landing page at the root of a notebook.

- This is a long line. It is very long
  indeed. So long, in fact, as to cause it
  to wrap. Now the question is, What will
  happen on the next wrap. Back to the left?
  No! Things are working now!

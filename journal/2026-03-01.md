- Yesterday built drawer for kitchen.

- At some point in past, not sure when, I
  subscribed with Google to get more space.

- Jogging this morning.
    - 5.1 mi, 11:02 per mi, 138 bpm avg

- Upgraded iCloud for $2.99 per month to
  increase backup-storage from 50 GB to 200
  GB.

- Sent email to Mauricio Martinez to start
  thinking about whether I need to do
  anything for taxes for my mother for 2025.

- Checked FirstBank account. Checking has
  about $1300.
    - There is a monthly service-fee of
      $12.00.
    - So I need to close this account out.

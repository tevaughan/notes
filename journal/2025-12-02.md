- Went to motor-vehicle office on Coffman
  for appointment at 07:20.
    - Changed title of 2017 Camry so that
      only my name is on the new title.
    - Presented
        - both death-certificates,
        - my letters testamentary for Mary,
          and
        - my notarized affidavit of small
          estate for George.
    - These were sufficient.

- Sent to Nicholas via overnight UPS:
    - temporary license-plate and
    - temporary registration.

- The plan is for me to sign over the title
  when Nicholas comes to visit at Christmas.
    - The temporary registration extends
      until 2026 Jan 29.

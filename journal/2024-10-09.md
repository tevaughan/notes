- At [tdcosta100's tutorial][tutorial], I
  posted a comment asking for whether it
  might be possible for Xwayland _not_ to
  grab all X-traffic for `:0`.

  - Also, I asked for explanation of how to
    wire up sound in the X-session.

- Changed theme in nvchad to `oxycarbon`.
  - It has nice, bright near-white for main
    text in markdown.

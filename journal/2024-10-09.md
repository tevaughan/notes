- At [tdcosta100's tutorial][tutorial], I
  posted a comment asking for whether it
  might be possible for Xwayland _not_ to
  grab all X-traffic for `:0`.

  - Also, I asked for explanation of how to
    wire up sound in the X-session.

  - Answered one of my questions myself:
    - By editing `/etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf`,
      uncommenting the line that sets the
      `args`-variable, and adding ":1" to
      the list of arguments to `/usr/bin/X`
      (which is a logical link to
      `/usr/bin/Xorg`), I was able to get
      the full-screen session to use ':1'!
    - Now each shell in Windows Terminal,
      when launching an X-application,
      produces a window managed by MS
      Windows (on ':0').
    - And each application launched in XFCE,
      which was launched by LXDM, stays in
      the session by using :1.

- Changed theme in nvchad to `oxycarbon`.
  - It has nice, bright near-white for main
    text in markdown.

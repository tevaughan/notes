- Installed to weather-stripping on
  latch-side of front door.
  - New stripping is too narrow.
  - It is hard to position so that both
    there is a tight seal and the door can
    close.
  - The old stripping, with its wider,
    softer lining, was much easier to
    configure properly.
  - Probably need to get better stripping,
    and try again.

- Paid Colorado-tax for my mother's estate
  for 2024.
  - I had forgotten to pay and just received
    a notice of delinquency.
  - Put check into mail this evening.

- Picked up van on Friday from Stonum.
  - Spark-plugs were replaced.
  - Front shocks were replaced.
  - Oil and filter were changed.
  - Alignment was performed.
  - Tires were rotated.
    - Better tires are now on rear.

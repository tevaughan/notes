Jesse Kelly’s guest in the podcast that I listened to this morning (maybe from yesterday’s show) identified three enemies of Western civilization:

1. Wokeism
2. Islam
3. Liberal globalism

I wonder whether the first and third are really distinct. He talk of the third as the tendency toward international homogenization.

- Made new xfwm4-theme and added it to
  config-gitlab.

  - It is based on Greybird.
  - Modified all sides and corners to have
    12-pixel grab-width.
  - Modified all sides and corners to
    respect generic coloring based on
    color-theme.

- Picked different theme for vim because
  pastel colors seemed all too close to
  white on monitor at home.

- Widened scrollbar in Firefox on Debian
  stable on home-laptop.

- Filled out my investor-profile for Live
  Oak.

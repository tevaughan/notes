- Appointment with Mike Hostick of Live Oak
  is set for Thursday at 1pm (my time).

- Modified neovim's configuration so that
  `~/.cargo/bin/stylua` will, if it exist,
  be preferred over mason's stylua.

- Modified neovim's configuration so that
  `~/.python3-env/bin/pylsp` will, if it
  exist, be preferred over mason's pylsp.

- Modified neovim's configuration so that it
  has everything necessary for debugging in
  python.
  - Set up `nvim-dap`.
    - `<F5>` start/continue
    - `<F10>` step over
    - `<F11>` step into
    - `<F12>` step out
    - `<Leader>db` toggle breakpoint
    - `<Leader>dB` set conditional
      breakpoint.
  - For python, `<F5>` causes execution to
    begin as if `python <current file>` had
    been invoked, but in the debugger.
  - Set up `nvim-dap-ui` so that buffers
    showing variable-values,
    terminal-output, etc., open up around
    the source-buffer.
  - Installed `nvim-dap` and `nvim-nio` too.

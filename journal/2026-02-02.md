- A couple of weeks ago, I paid Google for
  more storage.

- No more meetings with Kim Scott at First
  Bank because Live Oak will do the rest of
  the Medallion stamps.

- Late last year, Stonum did a quick-fix for
  the side door's locking mechanism in the
  van.

- I have been taking creatine daily for a
  few weeks and plan to continue.

- Talked to CitiBank about my mother's old
  MasterCard.
    - A check for the balance will be sent
      within the next billing cycle.
    - Person with whom I spoke took my
      address and made a note for the check
      to be sent to me.
    - But I'd not be surprised if it be sent
      to Picket Lane because the address
      cannot be changed on the closed
      account.

- Did my python-exercises for today.
    - tracking of identity
    - mutability
    - comparison

- Physical exercise:
    - climbing for 16 min
    - initial stretching
    - pull-ups
    - push-ups
    - pikes and arches
    - handstand
    - two sets of eight squats at 135 lb

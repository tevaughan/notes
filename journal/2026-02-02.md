- Talked to CitiBank about my mother's old
  MasterCard.
    - A check for the balance will be sent
      within the next billing cycle.
    - Person with whom I spoke took my
      address and made a note for the check
      to be sent to me.
    - But I'd not be surprised if it be sent
      to Picket Lane because the address
      cannot be changed on the closed
      account.

- [“Magic”](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-reveal-the-role-of-magic-in-quantum-computational-power/) is defined as the degree to which a quantum system is not efficiently simulated classically.
  - Some highly entangled systems can be simulated efficiently in a classical computer.
  - So to assess the power of quantum computation relative to classical computation, one must quantify the degree of magic in the quantum system used for computation.

## 6015 Forest Ridge

- Doug Mollenkopf says that I need to call
  Ram Jack.
  - 210-970-7115
  - I need to get an estimate of the cost to
    repair the foundation.
  - This seems somewhow related to the
    replacement of the siding along one wall
    a few years ago.
  - Doug says that the appraiser requires
    an estimate of the cost of the
    foundation's repair in order to produce
    the appraisal-report.
  - Though it was almost 18:00 in San
    Antonio when I called, I did
    nevertheless contact a receptionist.

- Arose around 06:00.
- Jogged 1.5 at about 11:05 min/mi.
- Did not immediately enter shower because wife had put white power onto floor of shower.
- Instead, made bed and sat down on bed to cool off under fan while writing these notes.

- At confession yesterday, I vowed to improve my diligence at work.
  - Not just at my paid work, but at all work.
  - There seems to be a connection between prayer and good work.
  - Perhaps the sense in which one might pray always is just the sense in which one might always be engaged in good work.

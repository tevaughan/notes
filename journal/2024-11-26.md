- Last night, I bought a TCL 43-inch,
  4k-monitor.

  - This morning, I installed it onto
    Patrick's desk at his office.

- Today, I reviewed some documents from USAA
  for the estate. Coverage in effect from
  2024 Nov 10 until 2025 Nov 10 includes

  - umbrella-policy for liability on the
    three houses,
  - home-owner's policy for Turkey Point,
  - rental policy for Forest Ridge,

- I did not (yet) find in the mail the
  policy-packet for the home-owner's
  coverage for Picket Lane.
  - I called USAA and verified that Picket
    Lane is covered too.
  - And there is also a
    miscellaneous-property policy for the
    violin still in effect.
  - On the call, I also discovered that my
    mother's "subscriber-account" will pay
    out after the last policy in her name is
    closed.

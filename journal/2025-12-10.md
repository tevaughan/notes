- Finished a couple of 3-4 climbs at
  Climbing Collective this morning.
    - Did not, however, finish the first of
      the 3-4 climbs that I attempted this
      morning.
        - Blue holds on the north wall near
          the yoga-room.
    - Met Laura, who has seen that I have
      climbed with Benny in the morning.
    - While I was doing another climb, Laura
      succeeded at the first 3-4.
        - She said that I need to make a
          dynamic move, a jump, and to reach
          for the targeted hold, off to the
          left, with both hands.

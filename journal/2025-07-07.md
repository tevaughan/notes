- Met technician from JLB Services at 15:15
  at 742 Picket Ln.
  - He had already fixed leak in valve-box
    before I arrived.

- Cancelled Vanessa's blood-donation that
  had been scheduled for 2025 Jul 18 11:30
  because she has a conflicting appointment
  for Totus Tuus.

- Sent email to Live-Oak folks about
  stocks-packet and about withdrawing money
  to pay for college for Ana and Ciaran.

- Received information from Leo Chinchillas
  at City of Longmont.
  - He indicates that my change to the
    program of the sprinkler-system at 742
    Picket did produce a big reduction on
    July 06 and July 07.
  - He will be back in touch after July 13,
    when the bill prints, about whether he
    can make an adjustment.

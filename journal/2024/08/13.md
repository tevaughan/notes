- Started process of registration for 2011
  Toyota Corolla.

  - Paid $450 or so for tax on sale and for
    temporary registration.
  - Did emissions test.
  - Can apply for license-plates on line
    after 48 hours.

- Wrote hello-world program for rust on my
  Linux-laptop at home.

  - This is 1.1 of the book.
  - Changed my nvchad-setup to use `rustfmt`
    on saving a rust-buffer.
  - `println` is a _macro_.
  - Because of this, it is called as
    `println!(...)` with an
    exclamation-point (`!`).

- Wrote hello-cardo program.
  - `cargo run` rebuilds program if
    necessary and then runs it, all in one
    go.

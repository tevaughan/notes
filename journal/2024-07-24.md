- Jogged for a bit more than 10 minutes
  around Patrick' neighborhood, then walked
  for another 10 minutes or so.

- Texted Doug Mollenkopf to ask about where
  we are on appraisals of Forest Ridge and
  Turkey Point.

- Also asked him where we are with putting
  houses on the market and whether there be
  anything that needs to be done first.

- Texted Tito to see if there be any
  evidence of PoolSide's coming by
  yesterday.
  - I had talked to someone from PoolSide on
    Monday about the connector for the
    cleaner, and I was supposed to receive a
    text-message, but I don't recall
    receiving anything.

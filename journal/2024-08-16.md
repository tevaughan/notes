- Toward the end of his life, Pauli visited Einstein to discuss QM.
  - Einstein reiterated his refusal to accept that a system can be defined only by specifying the experimental method of observing it.
  - Yet it is not clear to me that this is precisely what QM demands.
    - A quantum state can be expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates of an observable, yes.
    - But is this the only way to express a general state?
    - And is this what Einstein was objecting to?

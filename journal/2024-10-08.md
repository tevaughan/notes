- Under WSLg, in Ubuntu-24.04, running in a
  full-screen session as under [tdcosta100's
  tutorial][tutorial], configured
  `pulseaudio` so that `pavucontrol` shows
  an output other than `dummy`.
  - Edited file:
    ```
    sudo vim /etc/pulse/client.conf
    ```
  - Uncommented and modified the following
    lines:
    ```
    default-server = unix:/run/user/1000/pulse/native
    autospawn = no
    ```

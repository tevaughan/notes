- Exercise
    - Climbing (even shorter than usual)
        - Took image of sky before sunrise
          outside of Climbing Collective.
            - Framed image so that
              street-light, which might have
              been an ugly obstacle in front
              of the pretty sky, be the
              central element in image.
            - This seemed a nice artistic
              choice and solved the problem
              of the foreground.
            - Sent image to Bart Conner,
              with whom I met yesterday and
              to whom I had mentioned
              working out at the climbing
              gym.
    - Initial stretching
    - Chin-ups (11)
    - Push-ups (22, starting to feel it at
      the end)
    - Handstand (45 seconds or so)
    - Pikes and arches
    - Straight jumps (11)
    - Standing backs (2)

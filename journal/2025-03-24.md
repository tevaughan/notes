## Review of Auto-Policy with USAA

Ethan's car

- Thomas E. Vaughan, Ethan E. Vaughan
- 00808 95 05C 7106 8
- 2012 Toyota Corolla
- 5YFBU4EE0CP044972

Ciaran's car

- Nicholas R. Vaughan
- 2012 Honda Civic
- 19XFB2F53CE380241

USAA says that I cannot put onto my
insurance the car that Ciaran is now driving
because the title is not in my name.

I canceled the Texas-policy because the
corresponding car is no longer in our
possession.

The 2017 Camry is still on my policy. We
need to get everything fixed for each car
when it comes up to Colorado next.

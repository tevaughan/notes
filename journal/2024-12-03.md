- Jogged 3.3-ish miles at abysmal pace of
  12:15 or so per mile on average.

  - Still recovering from cold.

  - First time to jog since returning from a
    week at sea-level.

  - First time to jog after a four-day gap.

- Spoke with a woman, Khadijih, at Red Frog
  today as I drank my coffee.

  - She is of Bahai religion.

  - She was interested in writing down the
    title of my book, Existence and the
    Existent, by Maritain.

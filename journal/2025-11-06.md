- Talked to Hostick at Live Oak today.
  - Transferred money from sale of Picket
    into post-tax account.
    - The post-tax account is a bit
      different from what I had thought.
      - It is like a cache.
      - Inputs:
        - Money from home-sales (done now).
        - RMD from beneficiary-account from
          Mary.
      - Outputs:
        - Withdrawals to pay for tuition for
          kids in college.
    - So far we have only ever taken RMD out
      of the beneficiary-account.
      - Nothing more.
    - That plus the home-sale proceeds has
      been used to pay for college so far.
  - Plan for stocks.
    - I should mail back every document,
      even the unfinished ones (without
      Medallion-stamp).
    - Live Oak will begin processing
      finished documents.
    - Starting in January, Live Oak will be
      able to affix Medallion-stamps.
    - So I should sign each unfinished
      document but not date it.
      - Live Oak can date it whenever the
        right documentation becomes
        available to stamp it.

- Maritain is focused, near the beginning of
  _Existence and the Existent_, on the idea
  of a transobjective subject.
  - A thing must first exist as a subject
    before the mind, in its first act,
    separates the thing's essence from the
    thing.
  - In the second act, the mind restores the
    essence to an act of existence as an
    object that corresponds the the things
    existence in the world outside of the
    mind.

St. Thomas is famous for resolving many a dispute by making a distinction between different senses of a key term in the dispute. In that spirit, the author here begins by distinguishing between the two main senses in which Aquinas can be said to have authority.

Aquinas has intrinsic authority from the quality and strength of his writing itself.

He has extrinsic authority by the testimony of others about him.

He has canonical authority, which is the specific kind of extrinsic authority due to testimony by the teaching authority of the Church.

The author in the article seeks to defend the claim, that “the slightest digression from Aquinas is neither permitted nor tolerated; but the Church urges and strongly praises fidelity in following him, even in minor matters.” Further, the author defends the claim made by the pre-conciliar manuals, that “a doctrine, by virtue of being held by St. Thomas, while not reaching the theological note of de fide or theologice certa, still holds a unique authority and can and must be held safely, with simple assent, while also respecting the opposite opinion of another School or Doctor.”

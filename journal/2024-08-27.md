- Modified journal() shell-function so that
  previous journal-entry is opened along
  with the one for the current day.

- Found work-around to problem when wsl is
  frozen.
  - I have seen this happen right after
    start-up, a couple of times over the
    last couple of weeks.
  - First, launch powershell as
    administrator.
  - `tasklist | findstr wsl`
  - Look for PID of `wslservice.exe`.
  - `taskkill /pid <PID> /f`
  - After that, all of the wsl-processes
    should be gone.
  - Also, typing `wsl -l` from a regular
    (not adminstrator) pwsh should work.
  - And launching wsl in Windows Terminal
    should work.

- Check out holoviz and hvplot.

- Replaced Arch's rust-package with Arch's
  rustup package in WSL on home-laptop.

- Started (again) on _The Rust Programming
  Language_.
  - https://gitlab.com/tevaughan/learning-rust
  - Made `hello_word` subdirectory.
  - What looks like function-call but with
    function-name terminating in '!' is a
    _macro call_, such as
    ```rust
    println!("Hello, world!");
    ```
  - But I do not know what "macro call"
    means in rust.
    - For now, book suggests that knowing
      that a call is a macro is good because
      a real function obeys rules, and a
      macro might not obey those rules.
  - Running `cargo new project_name` will
    usually make a new directory
    `project_name` and initialize it as a
    git-repository.
    - But this will not happen if the upper
      directory in which `cargo` is run is
      itself a git-repository.
    - Anyway, in `project_name/src/main.rs`
      will be the standard hello-world
      programe.
  - Inside the `project_name` directory,
    running `cargo build` will build the
    project.
    - The executable will be
      `target/debug/program_name`.
  - Inside `project_name`, running
    `cargo run` will (if necessary) build
    and (always) execute
    `target/debug/program_name`.
  - `cargo check` is faster than
    `cargo build` and verifies that build
    will work but does not generate an
    executable.
  - `cargo build --release` build the
    release-version instead of the
    debug-version.

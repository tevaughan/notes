- Kim from FirstBank called about the
  medallion-guarantees.
  - She left a voice-message.
  - Her number is 303-684-6886.
  - I called back and left a voice-message
    for her about my desire for a meeting.
  - I indicated that I put her number into
    my contacts so that I can more easily
    recognize it as a call to answer
    immediately.
  - Kim Scott.
  - kim.scott@efirstbank.com
  - My appointment is next Thursday at 2pm.

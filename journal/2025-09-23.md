- Matt has decided not to work on bathroom
  in basement.

- I texted Adam Hoffman to see if he might
  work on it.

- Cannot cancel watch-line at T-Mobile
  because I do not have permission to modify
  anything on our account except the line
  for my phone.

- Found title-complete notice and report for
  Ciaran's car's emissions-inspection.
  - These need to go with me to the meeting
    tomorrow.

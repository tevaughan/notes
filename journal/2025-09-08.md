- Cancelled current Citi card by protesting
  unknown recurring charge.
  - New card will be mailed out soon.
  - Some recurring charges are automatically
    updated for new card; others not.
  - Check mailed a week ago has not yet
    shown up as credited to Citi account.
    - Possibly did not spell amount in way
      that matched number in box.
  - So can't cancel card completely yet.
  - Logged in and paid by connected to Bank
    of America.
  - Tried cancelling card altogether over
    phone but was blocked by fact that I had
    done the protest today.
    - Agent said that she would monitor
      account and close it so soon as
      possible.

- Asked Mauricio for help with Medallion.

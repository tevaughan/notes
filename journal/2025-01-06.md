- This morning, I took Patrick, Michaella,
  and Lucy to the airport.

- Because I had a meeting in the morning in
  Westminster, I stopped at Starbucks near
  the office.
  - There I tested out for the first time my
    new noise-cancelling AirPods.
  - They are amazing in their ability to
    make one feel as if one reside in a
    space that is quieter than it actually
    is.
  - One difficulty that I encountered was in
    pairing the AirPods to my laptop for a
    Teams-meeting.
  - After successful pairing with the phone,
    the AirPods stubbornly refused to pair
    with the laptop.
  - Documentation on the web indicated the
    need to press the case's button in order
    to enter pairing mode on opening the
    case (after resetting the AirPods by
    stowing them for 30 seconds with the
    case closed).
  - But my case has no button.
  - Eventually I discovered, by forgetting
    the AirPods on my phone and the trying
    to pair them again, that one has to
    double-tap the front of the case.
  - My phone gave me this advice when I was
    traying to pair them after having had
    the phone forget them.
  - Using the double-tap, I was able to pair
    them with my laptop!

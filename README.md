# T. E. Vaughan's Journal and Notes

Repository for markdown-notes related to
everything except for paid work for my
employer.

I am managing the notes here via

- [mkdnflow][mkdnflow] in [neovim][neovim]
  and

- [GitJournal][GitJournal] on my iPhone.
    - I have GitJournal connected to this
      repository, but my intent for
      GitJournal is to use it mostly just to
      search and to read notes; to compose a
      note only in a pinch.

[neovim]: https://neovim.io
[GitJournal]: https://gitjournal.io

[mkdnflow][mkdnflow]'s author
[recommends][start] using `index.md` as the
landing page at the root of a notebook.

## Intent

Apart from this repository, I also keep a
hand-written journal.

My intent is

- to write notes here whenever I am at a
  keyboard with access to this repository

- to write notes in the hand-written journal
  either when away from an appropriate
  keyboard or when I need to draw something
  by hand.

I want to be able to write math.

- Here is some math for example: $\sqrt{x}$.

A goal is to find a balance that allows me
to copy things from the hand-written journal
into this repository at the end of the day.

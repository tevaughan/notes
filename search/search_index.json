Possible?","text":"<ul> <li>By the 1960s, Protestant nationalism had   given way to Enlightenment-liberalism,   \u201cliberal democracy,\u201d which promoted civil   rights but also lifted restrictions on   pornography and banished Christianity from   public schools.</li> <li>In US and Europe, liberalism was seen as   the final political theory that would   spread to every nation and last forever.</li> <li>Both parties in the US adopted some aspect   of this idea; among the Republicans it   took the form of libertarianism, but on   both sides the centrality of the nation   was downplayed or even opposed.</li> <li>The dominance of this view ended in   between 2016 and 2020, when the   Republicans advanced an America-first   agenda, and Democrats adopted openly   Marxist policies, including   intersectionality as means of identifying   oppressor and oppressed along racial   lines.</li> <li>Liberalism as the ascendant theory had   lasted only 60 years.</li> <li>The Anglo-American sentiment for the   constitutional tradition is still strong,   though, and it seems to provide a center   around which national conservatism might   play a role in reshaping the political   vision, perhaps in alliance with   anti-Marxist liberals (libertarians and   others).</li> <li>A problem for conservatives to overcome is   ignorance of why \u201cGod and Scripture,   nation and congregation, marriage and   family, man and woman, honor and loyalty,   the sabbath and the sacred\u201d should be   conserved.</li> <li>Liberalism (including libertarianism)   conserves nothing.</li> <li>Liberalism is devoted entirely to freedom,   even freedom from the past, and it is thus   opposed to the conservation of what is   good from the past into the present and   future.</li> <li>A revival must include a rediscovery of   the practice of studying history in order   to preserve what is good, and it must   involve not only conservative government   but also the practice of being personally   conservative and living conservatively.</li> <li>A revival requires repentance, retracing   steps, undoing what was wrongly done, and   setting out again on the right path.</li> <li>In politics, conservatism refers to \u201cthe   recovery, restoration, elaboration, and   repair of national and religious   traditions as the key to maintaining a   nation and strengthening it through time.\u201d</li> <li>Anglo-American conservatism:</li> <li>John Fortescue (1400s)</li> <li>Richard Hooker (1500s)</li> <li>John Selden, Matthew Hale (1600s)</li> <li>Edmund Burke, George Washington, John     Jay, John Adams, Gouverneur Morris,     Alexander Hamilton (1700s).</li> <li>Daniel Webster (1800s) espoused what     Hazony calls \u201cnational conservatism.\u201d</li> <li>Anglo-American conservatism properly   becomes national conservatism whenever   forces threaten to dissolve the nation,   whether from within or from without.</li> </ul>

in Hazony\u2019s view is not universal but   particular to the culture of a nation.</li> <li>In the introduction, he had mentioned his   not being an advocate of defining   \u201cconservative\u201d (as I do) in terms of the   natural law.</li> <li>In my view, conservatism is, so far as it   respects the natural law, just so   universal as liberalism is.</li> <li>Yet Hazony is in part right because   conservatism must look to the cultural and   national particularities for material to   arrange, to inform.</li> <li>Perhaps Aquinas might agree that natural   law is the form of conservatism, but   each individual instance of it would be a   unique individual because its cultural   matter is a principle of individuality.</li> <li>Hazony, focusing on the particularity,   denies the universal aspect, but I suspect   that his love for the Anglo-American   version of conservatism owes precisely to   its end in representing the very natural   law that Hazony, like the liberals whom he   decries, seems to think that the mind   cannot comprehend well enough to craft a   political philosophy.</li>

For example, Rich talks about quarks, but it takes a couple of seconds before a depiction of quarks shows up on the screen.</p> <p>A general comment that I have is perhaps one that cannot have much effect and cannot be taken as any kind of direction. I offer it only in case it might somehow be useful to someone: I should like to avoid the appearance of advocating the reductionistic materialism that every physicist and engineer of secular inclination is inclined toward these days. I should like to avoid the view that everyone who is unaware of Aristotelian and Thomistic metaphysics naturally adopts when receiving a technical education these days. I\u2019ll spend a few words here below, but I want reiterate that this is not a recommendation for any change to the documentary.</p> <p>Yet what I want to avoid is the view according to which water-molecules actually exist in liquid water.</p> <p>A water-molecule might actually exist, might be a substance itself, before joining a volume of liquid. After joining, however, it seems possible to me that the molecule might no longer actually exist, though it still really exists as a potency in the liquid substance. It transforms from a real actuality as a substance on its own into a real potency within another substance, the liquid. This seems possible on the quantum mechanical description if we suppose that there is a lot of entanglement among dissociated atoms and molecules in liquid water, so that the full property of the liquid is only properly described more or less by a single wavefunction spanning the liquid\u2019s volume.</p> <p>I make this point as a specific example of a more general idea. On the one hand, we have a hierarchy of theories spanning from preons at the bottom, to particles of the standard model, to atoms, to molecules, to inanimate macroscopic substances, to plants, to animals, to the bodies of rational animals, to celestial objects, to the evolution of spacetime itself. On the other hand, there seems to be a boundary that prevents the reduction of one theory merely to a theory in which more fundamental parts explain everything. Water seems not merely to be molecules. A human person especially seems not merely to be molecules.</p> <p>Yet it seems necessary to develop a hierarchy of theories in order to make best sense of the world, even if we know that the theories of things that can never be seen are likely not right. Necessary because the human mind seems built to have at least some imperfect understanding of all that is, and because God in His mercy makes the universe comprehensible to us. Even if that comprehension is always flawed, it seems ill considered to reject the gift. Rather, we must accept it as did the good steward in the parable of the talents. By working hard to develop the gift of comprehension, we might hope to do great things in the world, to become worthy stewards of creation.</p>"},{"location":"journal/2024-12-31/","title":"2024-12-31","text":"<p>UPC code for Ruger Mark 4 Hunter Stainless 6.88\u201d barrel:</p> <p>.22 caliber Ruger 736676401604</p> <p>Search for this at ammoseek.com.
